# Squid-Games-Hack


## Inspiration
We recently went on a trip to Bangalore and realised how difficult and distracting the travelling websites actually is and 
how chaotic it can get when someone is trying to design their own itinerary.

## What it does
It makes it simple for people to design their itineraries and make a sound choice in booking their vacations.

## How you built it
We built it using ReactJS for the frontend, and NodeJS for the backend.

## Challenges you ran into
Time, API's we wanted access to were paid, no App Developer.

## Accomplishments that you are proud of my making this project
Functioning together as a team in making a percentage of a huge project in a very short amount of time.
